3. **User-Centered Design (UCD)**
   - Prioritize user needs in the interface design.

4. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Implement error handling to ensure stability.

### Implementation Techniques

1. **Java Swing for User Interface**
   - Components like buttons, text fields, and tables.

2. **db4o for Data Persistence**
   - Storing and managing data using db4o.

3. **Database Design**
   - Efficient schema design and relationships.

4. **Multithreading**
   - Asynchronous tasks for improved performance.

5. **Security**
   - User authentication, authorization, and data encryption.

6. **Unit Testing and Integration Testing**
   - Ensuring component functionality and interaction.

7. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**
   - Automating build, test, and deployment processes.

8. **Documentation**
